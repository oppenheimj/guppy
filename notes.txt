Two primary use cases for rendering things:
- Terrain chunks
    - pos/col/nor/uv must be represented per-vertex
    - Less data transfer, more client-side compute: pass height map
    - More data transfer, less client-side compute: pass all vertices
    - Should transfer less data. Pass a height map, let client construct buffers
    - Proceed by making fewest possible changes to server-side code
- Variable number of instances of meshes
    - How to do instance rendering with variable number of instances 
        - does shader need to know how many instances?

Draw calls:
- One per terrain chunk
- One for all of each type of model
